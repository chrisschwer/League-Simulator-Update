- Implemented early termination for hanging tests

### 2. Test Optimization
- **Parallel Testing**: Tests split into 4 shards running concurrently
- **Incremental Testing**: Only tests affected by changes are run
- **Dependency Analysis**: Smart test selection based on file changes

### 3. Container Structure Tests
- Fixed hardcoded R version expectations
- Removed problematic permission checks
- Added dynamic version validation

### 4. Error Handling
- Removed `continue-on-error` flags that masked failures
- Implemented proper error categorization
- Added automated failure analysis

### 5. Monitoring & Visibility
- **CI Dashboard**: Real-time performance metrics
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Automatic quarantine of unstable tests
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage tracking
