Create a comprehensive GitHub issue for: $ARGUMENTS

First, I'll analyze your request to determine the type of issue and gather necessary information.

## Initial Analysis

Based on your description, I need to determine:
1. **Issue Type**: Is this a feature request, bug report, enhancement, documentation, or other type?
2. **Missing Information**: What details do I need to create a well-structured issue?

Let me ask clarifying questions to ensure I create a complete issue.

### For Feature Requests:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who are the target users?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- Are there any technical constraints?
- What's the expected timeline?
- What's the priority level? (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, or P3-Low)

### For Bug Reports:
- What is the current behavior?
- What is the expected behavior?
- Steps to reproduce?
- What environment/version?
- How critical is this bug? (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, or P3-Low)
- Are there any workarounds?

### For Enhancements:
- What current functionality needs improvement?
- What specific improvements are needed?
- Who will benefit from this enhancement?
- What's the priority level? (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, or P3-Low)

### For Documentation:
- What needs to be documented?
- Who is the target audience?
- What format is preferred?
- What's the priority level? (P0-Critical, P1-High, P2-Medium, or P3-Low)

## Issue Creation

Once I have the necessary information, I'll create a properly structured issue with:

### For Features (type:feature):
1. **Feature Summary**
2. **Background & Motivation**
3. **User Stories** (at least 3 perspectives)
4. **Acceptance Criteria**
5. **Technical Specification**
6. **Dependencies**
7. **Definition of Done**
8. **Estimated Effort**
9. **Success Metrics**

### For Bugs (type:bug):
1. **Bug Summary**
2. **Current Behavior**
3. **Expected Behavior**
4. **Steps to Reproduce**
5. **Environment Details**
6. **Impact/Severity**
7. **Possible Root Cause**
8. **Proposed Fix**
9. **Testing Requirements**

### For Enhancements (type:enhancement):
1. **Enhancement Summary**
2. **Current State**
3. **Proposed Improvement**
4. **User Impact**
5. **Technical Approach**
6. **Success Criteria**

### For Documentation (type:documentation):
1. **Documentation Summary**
2. **Target Audience**
3. **Scope and Content**
4. **Format and Location**
5. **Review Requirements**

## Labels
I'll apply appropriate labels:
- Type label: type:feature, type:bug, type:enhancement, type:documentation, etc.
- **Always include**: status:new (to trigger the workflow)
- Priority label (choose one):
  - P0-Critical: System down, data loss risk, or security vulnerability
  - P1-High: Major functionality broken, significant user impact
  - P2-Medium: Important features or bugs affecting subset of users
  - P3-Low: Nice-to-have improvements, minor issues

## Projects Board Integration
After creating the issue, I'll automatically:
- Add the issue to the "Claude Code Workflow" Projects board
- Place it in the "ðŸ†• New Issues" column
- Set the Priority field to match the priority label
- Set the Stage Entry Time to the current date
- Sync all relevant fields for workflow tracking

Please provide any missing information so I can create a comprehensive, well-structured issue.
