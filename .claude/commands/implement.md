Implement the approved plan for $ARGUMENTS by:

1. **Following the implementation plan exactly**:
   - Work through each phase systematically
   - Create/modify files as specified
   - Maintain the planned architecture

2. **Code Quality Standards**:
   - Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
   - Add appropriate comments for complex logic
   - Follow project coding conventions
   - Ensure proper error handling throughout

3. **Testing as you go**:
   - Run tests after each significant change
   - Ensure no regressions are introduced
   - Verify the implementation matches test expectations

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update code comments
   - Add/update API documentation
   - Document any deviations from the plan

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement efficient algorithms
   - Avoid unnecessary computations
   - Consider caching where appropriate

6. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Never log sensitive data

Create production-ready code that passes all tests and meets all requirements.
