Create a detailed implementation plan for $ARGUMENTS with the following structure:

1. **Implementation Overview**:
   - High-level approach and architecture
   - Key design decisions and rationale
   - Technology choices and justification

2. **Phase Breakdown**:
   - Phase 1: Foundation (list specific tasks)
   - Phase 2: Core functionality (list specific tasks)
   - Phase 3: Integration (list specific tasks)
   - Phase 4: Polish and optimization (list specific tasks)

3. **File Changes**:
   - Files to be created (with purpose)
   - Files to be modified (with specific changes)
   - Files to be deleted (if any)

4. **Data Flow**:
   - How data moves through the system
   - State management approach
   - API contracts and interfaces

5. **Error Handling Strategy**:
   - How errors will be caught and handled
   - Logging approach
   - User-facing error messages

6. **Rollback Plan**:
   - How to revert if issues arise
   - Feature flags or gradual rollout
   - Data migration rollback (if applicable)

7. **Time Estimates**:
   - Hours per phase
   - Total implementation time
   - Testing and review time

8. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Technical risks and mitigation
   - Dependencies that could cause delays
   - Complexity hotspots

Make the plan detailed enough that any developer could implement it successfully.
