# Session Notes - 2025-07-19

## Today's Achievements

### Major Completions
- **Issue #26**: Converted Kubernetes Deployments to CronJob-based pod lifecycle management ✅
- **Issue #27**: Extracted team data to ConfigMaps for dynamic updates ✅  
- **Issue #28**: Enhanced CI/CD pipeline for automated Docker builds and Kubernetes deployment ✅
- **Issue #25**: Optimized Docker images to reduce size by 75% ✅

### Workflow Management
- Successfully cleaned up 3 completed worktrees (issues #26, #27, #28)
- Freed ~4.8MB of disk space from stale development environments
- Maintained clean git repository with only main worktree remaining

### Active Issues
- **Issue #30**: Health checks, probes, and basic monitoring (status:new, priority:medium)
- **Issue #29**: Comprehensive test infrastructure for deployment safety (status:new, priority:medium)

## Technical Context for Next Session

### Repository Status
- Main branch is clean with no uncommitted changes
- Branch is 15 commits behind origin/main (needs pull to sync)
- All worktrees have been cleaned up successfully
- Remote branches for completed features still exist but are merged

### Workflow State
- 2 new issues (#29, #30) awaiting analysis and progression
- Both issues are enhancement requests with medium priority
- No human reviews currently pending
- No active parallel development streams

### Key Technical Decisions Made
1. Implemented CronJob-based architecture for resource optimization
2. Extracted team data to ConfigMaps for better Kubernetes-native configuration
3. Enhanced CI/CD with Docker Hub integration and automated deployments
4. Established comprehensive worktree cleanup procedures

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Sync Repository**: Pull latest changes from origin/main (15 commits behind)
2. **Progress Issue #30**: Start analysis for health checks and monitoring implementation
3. **Progress Issue #29**: Begin test infrastructure planning
4. **Consider Meta-Planning**: Analyze dependencies between monitoring and testing features

## Blockers & Considerations

- No current blockers identified
- Repository synchronization needed before starting new work
- Both new issues are related to DevOps/infrastructure improvements
- May benefit from combined approach since both relate to deployment safety

## Workflow Insights

- Worktree-based development worked excellently for parallel feature development
- End-of-day cleanup processes are effective for maintaining repository hygiene
- Issue progression through the 11-stage workflow has been smooth
- Human approval gates successfully prevented issues while maintaining velocity
