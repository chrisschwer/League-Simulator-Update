## Key Issues Identified

### 1. CSV Generation Tests
- Functions from csv_generation.R not properly loaded after commenting out merge_league_files
- Affects 2 tests in test-csv-generation-fixes.R

### 2. C++ Component Issues
- Multiple test files experiencing compilation or linking errors
- Affects: SaisonSimulierenCPP, SpielCPP, simulationsCPP tests
- Total impact: ~30 test errors

### 3. Season Processor Tests
- Errors related to the namespace collision fix in issue #64
- merge_league_files function not found in test environment

### 4. Interactive Prompts
- Tests are outputting interactive prompts despite non-interactive mode settings
- Causes test output pollution and potential hanging

## Recent Changes Impact

### Issue #64 Resolution
- Commented out csv_generation.R version of merge_league_files
- Commented out associated test
- Added deprecation notices (Remove after August 15, 2026)
- Result: Namespace collision resolved but some tests now failing to find functions

### Issue #65 Resolution
- Fixed test expectation for validate_team_count error handling
- Changed from expecting "Error reading file" to "Too few teams"
- Result: Test now passes correctly

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix C++ compilation issues affecting 3 test files
   - Ensure csv_generation.R functions are properly loaded in test environment
   - Address interactive prompt issues in test setup

2. **Medium Term**
   - Review and fix the 68 test errors
   - Investigate why performance tests are all skipped
   - Improve test isolation to prevent cross-test interference

3. **Long Term**
   - Consider splitting large test files for better maintainability
   - Add integration test coverage for the monolithic deployment
   - Document test dependencies and setup requirements

## Test Health Metrics

- **Green (Healthy)**: 18 files with all tests passing
- **Yellow (Needs Attention)**: 9 files with failures or errors
- **Gray (Skipped)**: 1 file with all tests skipped

Overall, the test suite is in reasonable health with most core functionality tests passing. The main areas needing attention are C++ components and recent changes to the CSV generation module.
